## 🚨 Attention

This software is still in the **development phase** and has not yet been officially released.

## 🧭 Concept

- **Distributed & Decentralized**
  - To make the metaverse as certain as reality, it must not become fragile things dependent on each company and platform. Virtual Reality, forever.
  - Heavily influenced by the Fediverse built by ActivityPub.

## ✨ Design

- **Bloom**
  - Bloom (commonly called an instance) works as an independent metaverse platform: play with friends, share worlds and items. All blooms communicate with each other, and be able to access contents of other blooms.
- **Sandbox Enviroment**
  - Complete data processing within the sandbox environment. Prevent viruses and malicious scripts from executing and influencing the outside world.
- **SuteraVR SDK**
  - You can upload avatars/worlds/items, and attach functions as you like by coding.
- **Management of Permissions**

## 🌼 Name Origin

Are you worrying that "Sutera" is a misspelling of "Stella"?
The name comes from the Sutera flower of the Scrophulariaceae family, known as Bacopa.
